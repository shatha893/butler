* I should write a bunch of modules (functions)

* File transfer
* I will be downloading the script after I got a rev shell
* Ask user to go to /tmp or maybe I can download shit in /tmp without the user being there.
* I want to download linpeas, run it and save the output in a file

* Simplify getting reverse shells as follows  

  1. I have to handle the file transfer between the two machines
* How do I do that?   
    * 
 2. I have to make sure that I can transfer files with a simple sh shell before I upgrade it.
* The user has to be in a writable directory when running the script on the victim machine
 3. I want to transfer the following files  
    * Linpeas, linenum and lse
    * suid3num or sth like that ( I forgot the name ).
    * pspy
    * I have this idea to add these files in the repository of the code so that the user doesn't have to download them separately
    * So that *I* don't have to download them separately or worry if they're in the same directory I'm in...etc
* 4. I want to run the files and write their output each in a separate file
* 5. I also want to create a directory to put these files and their output inside of it.
* For pspy I can run it maybe for like 5 minutes to check for the cron jobs and if I can save its output in a file too.
* But maybe 5 minutes is a very long time for a script to run. So I'll see what to do about it. Maybe just copy the pspy binary and then let the user run it
* 6. Now I have to upgrade the reverse shell (I'll research that more).
